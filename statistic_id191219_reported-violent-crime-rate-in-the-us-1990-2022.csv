"","","","","In 2022, the violent crime rate in the United States was 369.8 cases per 100,000 of the population. Even though the violent crime rate has been decreasing since 1990, the United States tops the ranking of countries with the most prisoners . In addition, due to the FBI's recent transition to a new crime reporting system in which law enforcement agencies voluntarily submit crime reports , data may not accurately reflect the total number of crimes committed.



 Reported violent crime rate in the United States 

The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks the rate of reported violent crimes per 100,000 U.S. inhabitants. In the timeline above, rates are shown starting in 1990. The rate of reported violent crime has fallen since a high of 758.20 reported crimes in 1991 to a low of 363.6 reported violent crimes in 2014.



In 2022, there were roughly 1.23 million violent crimes reported to the FBI in the United States. This number can be compared to the total number of property crimes, roughly 6.51 million that year. Of violent crimes in 2022, there were 893,980 aggravated assaults, making this offense the most common of violent crime offenses.



 Law enforcement officers and crime clearance 

Though the violent crime rate was down in 2013, the number of law enforcement officers also fell. Between 2005 and 2009, the number of law enforcement officers in the United States rose from around 673,100 to 708,600. However, since 2009, the number of officers fell to a low of 626,900 officers in 2013. The number of law enforcement officers has since grown, reaching 708,001 in 2022.



In 2022, the crime clearance rate in the U.S. was highest for murders and non-negligent homicides, with around 52.3 percent of murders being solved by investigators and a suspect being charged with the crime. Roughly 41.4 percent of aggravated assaults were cleared in that year. A statistics report on violent crime in the U.S. can be found here ."

In the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the UCR Program as those offenses which involve force or threat of force. The data from previous years can be accessed at the Uniform Crime Reports section on the Website of the FBI .
